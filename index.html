        <p>
            Hello, my name is Colton and I am a software developer. 
            This December, I will graduate from Tennessee Tech with a BS in Computer Science. 
            I am currently looking for an internship or job in my field.

                <h3>Bridging Hope</h3>
                <p>
                    Bridging Hope is my senior project for my Bachelor's degree from Tennessee Tech.
                    The finished product will be a web application that allows volunteers at nonprofits track the aid they give to people.
                    It will also help people in need find resources in their area.

                <h3>Arduino IOT Simulator</h3>
                <p>
                    I worked with a small team in my Web Development class to build an Internet of Things simulator for a "smart chicken coop." 
                    We used Arduino controllers with humidity and temperature sensors, a motor, a motion sensor, and LEDs to get readings for the conditions of the coop and to simulate opening/closing a coop door. 
                    We utilized software taught in the class such as Node.js, HTML, Bootstrap, jQuery, and SweetAlert2 to build a RESTful API that a client could connect to and manage their SmartCoop. 
                    See the link below for our GitHub repository.
