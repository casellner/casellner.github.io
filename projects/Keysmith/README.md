# Keysmith
This project is a simple game which allows one to improve typing while playing a game with a sense of progression. The typist will collect resources and use those to collect more and type bigger words.

## My Goals for this Project
1. Something productive to do while passing the time
2. Small amount of income through unobtrusive ads
3. Typing practice for myself
